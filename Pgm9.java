/*
Given that an EMPLOYEE class contains the following members:
Members: Employee ID, Employee Name, Department name & Basic
Pay 
Methods: To read each employee details, to calculate Gross Pay and
to print the employee details. Develop an application to read data of N
employees and com pute the Gross Pay and Net Pay of each employee.
Gross Pay = Basic Pay + DA + HRA (DA = 58% of Basic Pay, HRA =
16% of Basic Pay)
Net Pay = Grossâ€“ Income Tax
Income Tax calculated as follows:
Gross Pay - Up to2 lakhs -Nil
Above 2 and up to3 lakhs - 10% of the Gross
Pay Above 3 and up to5 lakhs - 15% of the Gross
Pay and
Above 5 lakhs 30 % of the Gross Pay, an additional charge of 2% of the
tax will be added to total tax
